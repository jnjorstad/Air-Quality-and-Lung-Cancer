Each of the following machine learning models fall into supervised learning.


Linear regression
The linear regression algorithm is the most fundamental of machine learning models.
It finds the best linear line and the best values of intercept and coefficients to reduce error.
We used the multiple linear regression model in order to apply multiple independent variables.
r-squared: 0.9991


Support Vector Machine Regression
Although widely used for classification purposes, support vector machine (SVM) is popular
due to it producing significant accuracy with less computation power. The goal in SVM is
to find a hyperplane that has the maximum margin (the max distance between data points of each class)
in an N-dimensional space that classifies the data points.
mean-squared: 3.2868


Random Forest Regression
To combat the potential outcome of over-fitting in a decision tree model, we tested our data using
the random forest algorithm. It combines predictions from multiple decision trees for an average 
to create a more accurate prediction than a single model could. It uses bagging and feature randomness
to build individual trees to create an uncorrelated forest.
mean-squared: 1.0725
