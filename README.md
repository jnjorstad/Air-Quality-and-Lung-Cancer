# Air-Quality-and-Lung-Cancer

# Background
Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women in the U.S. When you think of risk factors for lung cancer, what comes to mind? Most of us think about the risk associated with smoking cigarettes, but did you know that environmental qualities including air pollution can also cause lung cancer? Overwhelming evidence shows that particle pollution in the outdoor air we breathe—like that coming from vehicle exhaust, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources—can cause lung cancer.

In this project, using ETL and Supervised Machine Learning methods, we tested different regression models to predict how environmental qualities can have an effect on lung cancer mortality in the United States.
